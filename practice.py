# ============
# You will need to write two functions for this problem. The first function, divide that takes in any number and returns that same number divided by 2. The second function called sum should take any number, divide it by 2, and add 6. It should return this new number. You should call the divide function within the sum function. Do not worry about decimals.

    return x / 2

# print(sum(4))

# An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

# In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

# The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
